Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the Magnetic Resonance in Medicine paper by Michael Loecher et al entitled "[*Time‐optimized 4D phase contrast MRI with real‐time convex optimization of gradient waveforms and fast excitation methods*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27716)".


This Jupyter Book lets you interact with a [demo of their code](https://github.com/mloecher/cvxflow) used to generate gradient waveforms for 4D-Flow MRI. You can change the code by inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in another tab. The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com).
