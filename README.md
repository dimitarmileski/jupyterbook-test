### Time-optimized 4D phase contrast MRI with real-time convex optimization of gradient waveforms and fast excitation methods

*Michael Loecher* | *Patrick Magrath* | *Eric Aliotta* | *Daniel B. Ennis* 

**Purpose**: To shorten 4D flow acquisitions by shortening TRs with fast RF pulses and gradient waveforms. Real‚Äêtime convex optimization is used to generate these gradients waveforms on the scanner.
